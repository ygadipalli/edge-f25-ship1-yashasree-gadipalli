# Ship 1 - Python Track

**Welcome to Edge Labs!** This is your Ship 1 project - adding timestamps to a Python CLI app.

## Quick Overview

You're building on Ship 0 by adding **timestamps** to your ship log entries. Look for `# TODO:` comments in the code - they tell you exactly what to implement!

**What you'll learn:**
- Working with dates and times in Python
- Adding features to existing code
- More Git/GitHub practice
